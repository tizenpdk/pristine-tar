=head1 NAME

zgz - Frankenstein's compressor

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<zgz> [options] < file > file.gz

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program is an unholy combination of the BSD gzip program, a modified
GNU gzip that supports setting an arbitrary file name and timestamp,
and an old, rotting version of bzip2 that we dug up somewhere at midnight.
Only the bits to do with file compression were kept.

There are many arcane options which aid L<pristine-gz>(1) in re-animating
files. Use --help to see all the gory details.

Note that several of the above donors would be very suprised at finding
parts of themselves ... er, their work ... shambling around here. Please
direct correspondance and/or flaming pitchforks to the pristine-tar
